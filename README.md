For part one of the homework, I used a wine quality dataset to look at different wines and their quality. The first step is to load the libraries and the dataset to gain the information needed for the analysis. Once the data is loaded, the next step is to visualize it. In this specific plot, alcohol and malic acid were used for the plot to detect the quality.

After getting a visual of the data, it's important to standardize the features and split the data because it can rescale the features to avoid bias and improve the accuracy no matter how many times to edit the model. This dataset will be split 80/20, which represents 80% training and 20% testing.

Next it's time to train the svm model, predict how well the model will perform, and then evaluate it. This helps classify accurate data and once the code is ran the accuracy resulted in 0.97 which is very close to 1.

Now that the accuracy of the SVM model is given, next is the Decision Tree model. This model breaks down the directive that's used to predict the quality of wine. To generate this model, you would need to train the model, predict the results, calculate the accuracy, and visualize the data. The Decision Tree model has an accuracy of 0.94, which is accurate but less accurate compared to the svm model.

The final model to train and test is the Logistic Regression model. This is important to use in the wine dataset because it pays attention to the chemical properties and its relationship with the outcome of the wine and it's overall quality. Just like the other models, you have to train and predict the data, but with Logistic regression you have to include the Decision tree model. After initializing and predicting the Decision tree model into the logistic regression model, then you calculate the accuravy of the Logistic regression model. The result of the accuracy is 1.00, which is the most accurate result out of all three models.
